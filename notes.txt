red LED = board powered

Serial.println("text"); → shows on monitor

Use Tools > Serial monitor to see output

built-in LED usually on GPIO 2
Safe GPIOs for input/output: 2, 4, 5, 12-15, 18-19, 21-23, 25-27, 32-33
AVOID boot-mode conflict pins: 0, 2, 15 (only if not handled properly)

don’t forget pinMode() in setup()

use INPUT_PULLUP for buttons without resistor
